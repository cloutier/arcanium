Free and open source knowledge engine

You can make natural language queries to arcanium and get directly the answer. The system defaults to a websearch when it can't find the answer directly. 

This project aims to be the minimal glue between a lot of free software projects: solr, wikidata instead of knowledge graph, wikipedia.
The code aims to be as readable as possible. Make heavy use of RDF

## Why would you ever want to build something like this when Google, Bing, Wolfram Alpha and others exists?

I think the same open source revolution that Linux did to the operating system market could be also done to the search engines. This code is [copylefted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft) to make sure that everybody cooperates and improve the same codebase, just like Linux.
